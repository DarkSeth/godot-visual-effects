This hands-on tutorial series will teach you essential techniques to design effects such as explosions, ghost trails behind the player as in Castlevania games, lasers, background animation, and more.

## How to use

Download the Godot project. Each effect is in a self-contained directory with all its dependencies.

To add an effect to your own project, copy its directory to the root of your project, and move it from Godot's _FileSystem_ tab. That's it!
